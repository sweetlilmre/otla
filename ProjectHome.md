Vintage 8 bit machines used to load programs with cassette audiotapes. Data was encoded and decoded with an audio signal.

Those days normal loading speed was about 1000 - 2000 bps.

**Proyecto O.T.L.A.** will make loadings at 12000 bps or even faster using digital audio devices (cd and mp3 players , pc sound cards ...). Which means that loading a game will take  less than one minute, normally about 30 seconds.
